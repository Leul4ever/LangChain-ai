Leul, I’m truly honored to stand with you on this important day—your graduation from one of the world’s great universities. Moments like this matter. Not everyone’s path to success follows a straight academic line, and I know this because my own journey never included a college degree. In many ways, being here today feels like the closest I’ve ever come to a graduation ceremony.

Today, I want to share just three simple stories from my life. Nothing complicated. Just lessons that shaped who I became.

Story One: Connecting the Dots

My first story is about learning to trust the journey, even when it doesn’t make sense at the time.

I enrolled in college and stayed for only about six months before deciding to leave. For a while after that, I lingered—attending classes informally, learning what interested me—until I finally walked away completely. People often ask why I dropped out.

The truth is, my story began even before I was born. My biological mother was young and unmarried, and she made the difficult decision to give me up for adoption. She wanted me to grow up with parents who had gone to college, believing education would shape my future. Plans were made for me to be adopted by a well-educated couple—but at the very last moment, they changed their minds, hoping for a daughter instead.

That’s when my parents received a late-night call asking if they wanted to adopt a baby boy. They didn’t hesitate. They said yes.

Later, my biological mother discovered that my adoptive parents hadn’t finished college themselves. She struggled with that reality and delayed finalizing the adoption until they promised I would one day have the chance to attend college.

Seventeen years later, I kept that promise. I went to college—but I chose a school that was incredibly expensive. My parents were working-class, and nearly all their savings were poured into my tuition. After six months, I felt lost. I didn’t know what direction my life was headed in, and I couldn’t see how continuing down that path would help me discover it. What I did see was the weight of sacrifice my parents were carrying.

So I made a frightening decision: I stepped away.

At the time, it felt reckless. But in hindsight, it changed everything. Once I left the formal structure, I was free to explore—to stop forcing myself through classes that didn’t inspire me and instead learn from the ones that truly sparked my curiosity.

What I didn’t realize then was that every experience, every “unplanned” decision, would later connect in ways I could never have predicted.
